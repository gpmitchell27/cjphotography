			<p>Claire is an animal photographer. Her bio is short and sweet while also giving you a glimpse at her personality and love for animals: The camera is the least important element in photography.” -Julius Shulman
Claire combines her background as an award-winning advertising agency art director with her photography, creating modern, lifestyle portraits of people and animals. Her clients include ad agencies, magazines, publishing companies, celebrities, non-profit organizations and TV shows.
</p><p>When she’s not writing about herself in the third person, Claire likes to go hiking with her dogs, meditate, and grow organic heirloom tomatoes. She makes a mean guacamole (want to challenge her to a guac-off?) and really hates Comic Sans.
In her spare time, Claire photographs homeless dogs looking for their forever homes and donates her photography services every year to multiple dog rescue groups in Los Angeles. She lives in LA with her  husband and their two beloved rescue dogs, Maeby Fünke and Zoey.</p>
